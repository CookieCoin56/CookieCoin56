🍪 Hi, I’m CookieCoin! 🍪
Fun Fact: My name is CookieCoin, but I’m actually a token! 😄
Still, I have a big mission: There are 56 billion of me – why? Simple: Every person on Earth deserves 7 of me. Why 7? Because 7 is the number of perfection – and who doesn’t love perfect cookies? 😋

🧑‍🍳 My Ingredients:
Blockchain: I live on the fast and energy-efficient Solana blockchain 🌟.
Symbol: COOKIE – of course, what else? 🍪
Decimals: 8 – because I represent all of humanity!
Each CookieCoin can be divided into 8 decimal places, just like the 8 billion people on this planet 🌍.

🎯 My Mission:
I want to make the world sweeter!
Together with the Cookie community, we can drive projects in meme culture and digital innovation.
With my cool cookie circuit design, I combine cookies with technology – because cookies are just as important in the future as they are today! 🍪🤖

📅 My Roadmap:
Be born: ✅ – Mission accomplished!
Get verified: Soon, I’ll be available on the world’s best bakeries (platforms) 🍪✅.
Expand accessibility: The goal is to make CookieCoin tradable on as many platforms as possible, so everyone in the world can enjoy a piece of sweetness!
Foster innovation: From fun games to NFT marketplaces – I want to be wherever cookies bring joy! 🎮
